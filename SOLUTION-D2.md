To begin our work on deliverable 2, we first worked together to implement a single ASTNode subtype. This allowed us to understand how to implement the remaining subtypes, which were then divided between us and worked on independently. We each followed through with our subtype implementation by modifying ASTBuilder, ASTVisitor, and PrettyPrinter to support our new subtypes. This approach was easiest for us because it allowed us to each work on our own parts of the project independently without having to wait for the other person to complete their section before being able to move on to the next. 

An alternative approach to this deliverable that we considered was working together in segments on each extension, then splitting off and working independently. For example, after creating our ASTNode subtypes, we would meet to begin developing tests for those subtypes and complete the rest on our own. This approach would be followed for ASTBuilder, ASTVisitor, and PrettyPrinter. Ultimately, we decided against this approach because of scheduling constraints.

One difficult aspect of this deliverable was understanding how ASTBuilder interacts with both the ASTNode subtypes and the antlr4 generated parse tree. This was partly due to the fact that we needed to reference generated files in order to observe how Program Contexts were created so that we could properly extend ASTBuilder. Reviewing the code walkthroughs, referencing existing files, and slowly implementing the solution in small parts made this process easier. 

Tests for each extension were created, built, and run in parts based on the extension that was completed. For example, once all ASTNode subtypes were completed, they were tested to ensure correctness. Then, we moved on to extending ASTBuilder and testing these extensions in order to ensure correctness. This same approach was followed for ASTVisitor and PrettyPrinter. Test coverage was analyzed during these testing steps as well. Some important assumptions to make include the fact that our generated coverage.out is based off of running all the unit AND system tests, not just the unit tests. In addition, there is some missing coverage for base TIP features like while loops, field exprs, etc., which is fine since all of the new SIP features we implemented have 100% coverage in src/frontend/ast/treetypes. This also accounts for any missing coverage in src/frontend/iterators, src/frontend/prettyprint, and test/unit/frontend/treetypes.

Note that there are failing system tests in this deliverable, but this can be attributed to the fact that the remainder of the compiler has not yet been extended to fully support SIP features. All of the frontend unit tests pass, and these tests cover all of the compiler extensions completed in this deliverable.
