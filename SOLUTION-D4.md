To extend the code generator, our team split up the work for the required codegen functions and worked on them individually. We also met to discuss and synchronously work together on the implementation of the four array codegen functions, as this functionality was more complex than the others and it was easier to work on it together. Implementing many of the functions was relatively straightforward, and the LLVM IRBuilder class documentation, as well as the existing codegen functions in CodeGenFunctions.cpp, were referenced throughout the process. Our main challenge with this deliverable was implementing the four codegen functions required for arrays. It was difficult at first to figure out how to obtain the length of the array, get its element type, and subsequently create and store that array and its associated type. 

AN IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:
We were not able to finish implementing our codegen functions for both array constructors, the array length operator, and the array reference operator by the due date. This was mainly due to it being difficult to debug GEP and errorIntrinsic, as well as working on the these codegen functions last minute. However, I was able to take a look at these issues with the help of a TA (Nick) and devised a strategy to fix them, so these updated changes should be reflected in a new branch I pushed after the assignment due date.

For this deliverable, the first tests that had to be addressed were the existing system tests, as some of these were failing when the test suite was initially run. The main issue was the iotest fib.tip, which claimed that there were test differences despite not appearing to show such differences. This issue was resolved with the help of a TA (Nick) who found that switching the last two lines of the fib.ppps file solved the problem. The linkedlist.tip test, another existing test in the iotests subdirectory, was also reporting test differences. On Piazza, it was stated that this test pertains to the AST and pretty printer, and is thus not directly related to codegen, so its reported failures have been ignored as they are not directly related to this deliverable. Once the existing system test issues were resolved, the provided sip tests (from the siptests.zip folder) were added to ensure that our implementation of all codegen routines was correct. These tests allowed us to achieve high test coverage for the codegen portion of the compiler.
