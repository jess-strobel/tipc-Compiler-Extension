For this deliverable, our team decided that a pair-programming approach would be the best option for implementing new types, type constraints, and assignability checking. Initially, we planned to split the project up like we had with past deliverables. This would mean that we would each work on our own section independently, then come back together at the end to ensure that our work was correct and complete. This time, however, we realized that it was easiest to discuss type rules together and work synchronously to define and implement them. 

One difficult aspect of this project was determining which files needed to be modified. We followed the approach described at the end of the project writeup and began by implementing subtypes of TipType and then defining type rules in TypeConstraintVisitor.cpp. We knew that there were other files that depended on subtypes of TipType and the already existing type constraints, but it was challenging to determine which files needed to be changed and where those changes needed to occur. 

We also found it difficult to determine the proper order of the types in the expected output of our test cases. By following a post-order traversal of the AST and analyzing existing tests, we were able to determine the proper formatting for these expected outputs, though it did take a significant amount of time to do so.

The testing for this deliverable was primarily based on existing tests in the provided test files. Although the project implementation was written together, we each wrote separate tests in order to maximize efficiency. Since we had worked on the type rules together, it was not challenging to write tests independently, as we both understood exactly how we defined our TipType subtypes and type constraints.
